## Build setup

1. Install NPM (sudo if necessary)
2. Install Grunt (sudo if necessary) inside project folder "/"
3. Ensure that there is an appropriate "package.json" and Gruntfile from the GitREPO
4. Run "sudo npm install" from the "first-in-math" project folder to install local dependencies
5. Run "npm install grunt-postcss pixrem autoprefixer cssnano"
5. Run "grunt watch" to compile LESS and JS into minified CSS and JS files during development
6. Run "grunt http-server" to run a local webserver at "http://localhost:8888" to see the build live before uploading to remote HTTP server


That's it for now... more to come.
